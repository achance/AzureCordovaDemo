# Community Content - Apache Cordova

This folder contains content introducing Apache Cordova and demonstrating how to use it with Visual Studio to build cross-platform mobile apps. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Building Cross-Platform Mobile Apps with Visual Studio, Apache Cordova, and Microsoft Azure (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
